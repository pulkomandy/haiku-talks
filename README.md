Various talks about Haiku done at BeGeistet, Capitole du Libre, and elsewhere.

Before these get lost (again) in a filesystem corruption, let's put a copy on the internets!

They use either LaTeX or multitalk. PDF exports are provided for the LaeX ones because I'm not sure I can re-generate these.
Multitalk can export to HTML but the result is rather crap (all data embedded in png files) so I'd rather not export that.
I need to write a proper export code to HTML5 someday...
